# Virtual Piano

A lightweight, interactive virtual piano built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This project features a realistic design with 3D-like keys and synthetic sound generation using the Web Audio API.

## Features

-   **Realistic UI**: 3D key press effects and shadows for an immersive experience.
-   **Synthetic Sound**: Uses the Web Audio API to generate accurate frequencies for each note (no external audio files required).
-   **Responsive Design**: Built to work on various screen sizes (though optimized for desktop).
-   **Mouse & Touch Support**: Play by clicking or tapping on the keys.
-   **Standalone**: Single-file application (`index.html`) containing all styles and logic.
